<p>I love learning new things and applying creative strategies to unique projects. I explore a lot of my own struggles and identity in my conceptual work. I enjoy working in any medium from digital programs to acrylic paint and even embroidery.</p>

<p>I went to the arts high school, Perpich Center for Arts Education, my senior year. Then I went on to SAIC for undergrad for 2 years, this allowed me to explore conceptual design. Now I am finishing my undergrad at Columbia College Chicago. I have experience in both exhibitions and client-driven work. I am very good with time management and accountability.</p>

<p>I am passionate about nature and animals. I grew up always owning dogs and when I went off to live on my own, ended up needing an animal in my apartment. I acquired my tabby cat Mochi in 2017 and he is my world.</p>
